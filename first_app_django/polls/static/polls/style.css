/* 
django.contrib.staticfiles -> it collects static files from each of your applications and any other places you specify and puts them in a single location to be easily served in production.

django's STATICFILES_FINDERS setting -> it contains a list of finders that know how to discover static files from various sources.

i.e. AppDirectoriesFinder -> looks for a 'static' subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_APPS.

polls/static/polls/style.css -> can be referenced in templates as /polls/style.css due to AppDirectoriesFinder.
